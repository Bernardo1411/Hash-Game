# About the project

#### Link: https://hash-game.surge.sh/

It is estimated that tic-tac-toe was played by the Egyptians over 3500 years ago. Now this game is available on the web on the link above. 


In my version of the game, you will play against the computer. It will try to stop you! 


The algorithm developed will not use any kind of strategy, it will only check if you are about to win and then try to block you. Otherwise, it will make a "random" play.
On the link below, you can find an older version. In this version, you can play agains another player locally.
